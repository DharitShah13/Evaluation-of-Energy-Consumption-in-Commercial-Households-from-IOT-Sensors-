# Evaluation-of-Energy-Consumption-in-Commercial-Households-from-IOT-Sensors-

The data for this experiment is available at https://github.com/LuisM78/Appliances-energy-prediction-data

The data contains records of different appliances and their consumption in a particular household. The purpose of this assignment was to predict the energy consumption by employing feature engineering and exploratory analysis.

We had to develop a pipeline which would clean the data, handle missing values, generate custom features, try out different prediction algorithms and finally generate a report with the best possible algorithm for the job.

Highlights: 

We made use of automated libraries for feature selection like Boruta-Py, TPOT, Feature Tools, TSFresh
